# Wolfenstein: Blade of Agony - Kreisau Circle Edition
Welcome to the repository! This is a work-in-progress fork for merging the original 3.0 version of the game with the new 3.1 version. For those who are unaware, version 3.0 was censored by the original developer due to a combination of reasons, all amounting to censorship:
- Cyberterrorists (ie. Woketivists and other radicals)
- Government pressure (ie. Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [FOftPotC])
- Harassment and coercion from their own website host.

Regardless the factors, this is a safe-haven repository. We do not stand nor tolerate censorship of artistic freedom and creativity and vow to preserve the original content, with only a few necessary changes to eliminate any legal concerns (ie. unauthorized usage of names of GZDoom modders).

# DISCLAIMER
This is NOT an attack on the original creators of Blade of Agony, We understand (well somewhat at least) why they took the position they did. They had to do what they must to cover their own asses and avoid any legal consequences that may destroy them. Remember that these developers are based in Germany, a nation where "Nazi vs. Art" laws have not yet been abolished and only just been weakened recently (not enough to avoid a crackdown apparently). The German government is responsible for their capitulation. If they were living in the USA, or any nation where artistic freedom is completely protected under federal law, that would be a different story. I strongly ask that you do not harass or attack the original developers of the fan-made game.
